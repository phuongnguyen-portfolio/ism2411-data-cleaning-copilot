In this assignment, I have learned how to use GitHub Copilot to help me with coding for data cleaning, which is a helpful tool for beginners like me.

Specifically, I used Copilot to help me generate code blocks for cleaning string columns and handling missing values. I prompted these codes by commenting before each stage, and Copilot provided me with suggestions. However, I did not fully accept the recommendation of Copilot. For example, instead of accepting the recommendation to fill NaN with "0," I rather like it to use the mean value, which reflects the dataset more effectively. I also asked the Copilot to round the qty values to integers, which is easier to read.

Besides, I used the knowledge and skills learned in this course to create codes for other blocks, and revised it immediately after witnessing errors. Copilot did not convert string to numeric, so I had to do it on my own.

To sum up, Copilot is a useful tool for beginners, saving a lot of time and minimizing errors. However, we have to track its suggestions carefully, as some of them do not use the variables or paths we desire.
